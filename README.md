# Level-5 Blender Addon (Python)
___________________________________________________________________________
**Disclaimer**

I'm not affiliated with Level-5, I'm a fan who wants to know how level 5 files work.  

**What is the project**

Level-5 Blender Addon is a project to create an addon that can import and export some Level-5 files on Blender.
The addon is written in Python and the project is Open Source, everyone can contribute.

**Supported File**

- MTN2 (Animation) (Only Export)
- PRM (Mesh) (Only Export)
- XPCK (Model Archive) (Only Export)

**Special Thanks**  

My addon uses LZ10 compression code by RoadrunnerWMC and the triangle strop code by RuneBlade,  
also the project couldn't have been done without the logic that I could learn by studying Metanoia and Kurriimu.
- [RoadrunnerWMC (For LZ10)](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/ndspy)
- [Ploaj (For some logic about l5 files)](https://github.com/Ploaj/Metanoia/tree/master/Metanoia)
- RuneBlade (For triangle strip)

**How to Install**

This project hasn't release yet. The project is still in BETA, 
so please don't complain if the tool can't convert your model or if your model doesn't work in game.  
To install it you have to:  
- click on "Code" -> "Download zip", 
- wait the downkoad process
- now open Blender and on Blender click on "edit", "Preference", "Add-on", "install" and select the .zip you have downloaded
- don't forget to enable the addon!
