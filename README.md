___________________________________________________________________________
**Disclaimer**

I'm not affiliated with Level-5, I'm a fan who wants to know how level 5 files work.  

**What is the project**

Level-5 Blender Addon is a project to create an addon that can import and export some Level-5 files on Blender.
The addon is written in Python and the project is Open Source, everyone can contribute.

**Supported File**

- XMTN (Animation)
- XPRM (Mesh)
- XPCK (Model Archive)

**Available Template**

- Inazuma Eleven Go (IEGOCS/IEGOGALAXY)
- Yo-Kai Watch (YKW1/YKW2/YKW3/YKWB/YKWB2)

**Special Thanks**  

My addon uses LZ10 compression code by RoadrunnerWMC and the triangle strop code by RuneBlade,  
also the project couldn't have been done without the logic that I could learn by studying Metanoia and Kurriimu.
- [RoadrunnerWMC (For LZ10)](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/ndspy)
- [Ploaj (For some logic about l5 files)](https://github.com/Ploaj/Metanoia/tree/master/Metanoia)
