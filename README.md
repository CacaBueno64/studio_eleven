# Level-5 Blender Addon (Python)
___________________________________________________________________________
**Disclaimer**

I'm not affiliated with Level-5, I'm a fan who wants to know how level 5 files work.  
All these files are owned by Level-5

**What is the project**

Level-5 Blender Addon is a project to create an addon that can import and export some Level-5 files on Blender.
The addon is written in Python and the project is Open Source, everyone can contribute.

**Supported File**
- MTN2 (Animation) (Only Export)
- XPCK (3D Model Archive) (Only Export and need armarture)

**Special Thanks**
My addon uses LZ10 compression code by RoadrunnerWMC and the triangle strop code by RuneBlade,  
also the project couldn't have been done without the logic that I could learn by studying Metanoia and Kurriimu.
- [RoadrunnerWMC (For LZ10)](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/ndspy)
- [Ploaj (For some logic about l5 files)](https://github.com/Ploaj/Metanoia/tree/master/Metanoia)
- RuneBlade (For triangle strip)
